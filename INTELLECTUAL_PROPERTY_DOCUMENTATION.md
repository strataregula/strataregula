## Patent Application 1: Dynamic Configuration Pattern Learning System

### Title
**"Method and System for Dynamic Learning of Configuration Patterns from Structured Data Files"**

### Abstract

- **Step 2**: Parsing each file using language-specific parsers to extract key-value hierarchies
- **Step 3**: Identifying configuration patterns using regex-based pattern matching on key names
- **Step 4**: Extracting hierarchical components (environment, service, configuration type) from dot-notation patterns
- **Step 5**: Storing patterns in a frequency-weighted database with temporal metadata
- **Step 6**: Building dynamic completion vocabularies from learned pattern components

#### Claim 2: Temporal Pattern Weighting Algorithm
A method for weighting learned patterns comprising:
