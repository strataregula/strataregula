### Data Flow Architecture

1. **Pattern Discovery Phase**
   - User opens YAML files in workspace
   - YAML Analyzer scans files recursively
   - Patterns extracted and stored in learning database
   - Frequency analysis builds completion priority

2. **IntelliSense Phase**
   - User types in VS Code editor
   - Extension detects pattern context
   - Language Server queries learned patterns
   - Intelligent completions returned

3. **Continuous Learning Phase**
   - File changes monitored in real-time
   - Pattern database updated incrementally
   - Completion suggestions refined automatically

## Core Technical Components

### 1. YAML Pattern Analyzer (`yamlAnalyzer.ts`)

**Purpose**: Analyzes user YAML files to extract StrataRegula patterns dynamically

**Key Features**:
- Recursive YAML file scanning
- Pattern recognition using regex analysis
- Frequency-based learning with temporal weighting
- Multi-level hierarchy extraction (environment.service.config)

**Innovation Points**:
- **Dynamic Pattern Recognition**: Unlike static completion systems, learns from actual user configurations
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Understands YAML structure and extracts only valid StrataRegula patterns
- **Temporal Intelligence**: Weights recent patterns higher than historical ones

```typescript
export class YamlPatternAnalyzer {
  private learnedHierarchy: DynamicHierarchy;
  
  async analyzeDocument(document: TextDocument): Promise<StrataRegulaConfig> {
    const yamlData = yaml.load(document.getText());
    this.extractPatternsFromYaml(yamlData);
    return this.buildConfigFromLearning();
  }
  
  private learnPatternFromKey(pattern: string, context: string): void {
    // Extract hierarchy elements (environment, service, config)
    // Update frequency counters with temporal weighting
    // Store in dynamic learning database
  }
}
```

### 2. Pattern Completion Provider (`patternProvider.ts`)

**Purpose**: Provides intelligent completions using learned patterns

**Key Features**:
- Context-sensitive completion generation
- Multi-depth pattern analysis (env.service.config.*)
- Wildcard expansion support
- Real-time pattern validation

**Innovation Points**:
- **Depth-Aware Completions**: Different completion strategies for different nesting levels
- **Smart Filtering**: Filters completions based on current typing context
- **Template Suggestions**: Offers common pattern templates based on learned usage

### 3. VS Code Extension Integration (`extension.ts`)

**Purpose**: Seamless integration with VS Code editor experience

**Key Features**:
- Local Language Server Process (no external communication)
- Real-time pattern preview in WebView
- Context menu integration
- Configuration synchronization

**Innovation Points**:
- **Zero-Configuration Setup**: Works automatically with any YAML project
- **Privacy-First Design**: All processing happens locally
- **Live Preview**: Shows pattern expansions as user types
